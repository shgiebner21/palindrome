This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### This was a test I was given recently to display JavaScript skills.  It requires the use of raw JS date objects without the use of helper libraries like Moment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### put in error check if end date is before begin date
####   done
